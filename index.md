# Status
This is not a real project. It's only for **LEARNING** and **FUN** purposes.
This project is not yet finished, all the updates will be uploaded on the (Only Browser) version, in order for it to be seen and tried by users.
The code is as clear and available as I could, to help juniors and students who are still learning the basics.
I can add explaining comments at the end of the project if someone is interested.
